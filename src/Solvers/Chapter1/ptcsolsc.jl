C. T. Kelley, 2020

Scalar pseudo-transient continuation solver. PTC is designed to find
stable steady state solutions of 

dx/dt = - f(x)

The scalar code is a simple wrapper around a call to ptcsol.jl, the 
PTC solver for systems.

--> PTC is ABSOLUTELY NOT a general purpose nonlinear solver.

Input:\n
f: function\n
x: initial iterate/data\n
fp: derivative. If your derivative function is fp, you give me
its name. For example fp=foobar tells me that foobar is your
function for the derivative. The default is a forward difference
Jacobian that I provide.\n

Keyword Arguments:\n
rtol, atol: real and absolute error tolerances\n

maxit: upper bound on number of nonlinear iterations. This is 
coupled to delta0. If your choice of delta0 is too small (conservative)
then you'll need many iterations to converge and will need a larger
value of maxit.

delta0: initial pseudo time step. The default value of 1.e-3 is a bit 
conservative and is one option you really should play with. Look at the example
where I set it to 1.0!\n

dx: default = 1.e-7\n
difference increment in finite-difference derivatives
      h=dx*norm(x)+1.e-6

pdata:\n
precomputed data for the function/derivative.
Things will go better if you use this rather than hide the data
in global variables within the module for your function/derivative
If you use this option your function and derivative must take pdata 
as a second argument. eg f(x,pdata) and fp(x,pdata)

printerr: default = true\n
I print a helpful message when the solver fails. To supress that
message set printerr to false.

keepsolhist: if true you get the history of the iteration in the output 
tuple. This is on by default for scalar equations and off for systems.
Only turn it on if you have use for the data, which can get REALLY LARGE.

Output: A tuple (solution, functionval, history, idid, errcode, solhist) where
history is the array of absolute function values |f(x)|
of residual norms and time steps. Unless something has gone badly wrong,
delta approx |f(x_0)|/|f(x)|.

idid=true if the iteration succeeded and false if not.

errcode = 0 if if the iteration succeeded
        = -1 if the initial iterate satisifies the termination criteria
        = 10 if no convergence after maxit iterations

solhist=entire history of the iteration if keepsolhist=true\n
ptcsolsc builds solhist with a function from the Tools directory. For
systems, solhist is an N x K array where N is the length of x and K 
is the number of iteration + 1. So, for scalar equations (N=1), solhist
is a row vector. Hence I use [ptcout.solhist' ptcout.history] in the
example below.

If the iteration fails it's time to play with the tolerances, delta0, and maxit.
You are certain to fail if there is no stable solution to the equation.
